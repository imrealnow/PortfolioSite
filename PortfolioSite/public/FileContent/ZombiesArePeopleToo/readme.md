# Zombies are People Too

GMTK 2023 Game Jam Entry

Developed by Me and DKAMX using Unity, "Zombie Cure" offers a unique twist on the traditional zombie genre. Instead of combating the undead, players are tasked with healing them, turning foes back into friends!

## Concept

In the midst of a virus outbreak, players take on the role of a benevolent doctor. The objective? Cure the zombies and restore them to good health! But remember, while you're out trying to save some, make sure others don't see you as their next meal. Fortunately, once cured, zombies cannot be reinfected. And remember, no casualties allowed!
