# Ball Tapper

Ball Tapper was the first game I finished and released online on the google play store for android. I have developed a lot as a developer since I released it back in 2015, but I'm still proud of what I was able to achieve such a long time ago. The game had over 10,000 installs, and had had pretty positive feedback.
