# Portfolio Site

This is the very site you are on now. It's still a work in progress, but I'm pretty proud of what I have been able to achieve so far. The site is styled to resemble VS Code's interface design, which is the IDE I spend most of my time developing my projects in. There's still a lot more I can do to adapt it to better suit its role as highlighting my projects that I've worked on though.

I repurposed a lot of work I did for my other web app project, [FableFusion](https://fablefusion.tools/)
