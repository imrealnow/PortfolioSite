# FableFusion Overview:

To run a campaign in a tabletop RPG such as Dungeons and Dragons, Dungeon masters often have to use premade setting books, or spend a lot of time making their own worlds and campaigns to let their players explore. In the case of premade settings, they could be too restricted on how the players can explore the world. And in the case of making their own worlds, it can take a lot of time, is hard to do well and you can often be left with players choosing to do things you hadn’t prepared for.

Now with the recent influx of powerful LLMs(Large Language Models), there is an opportunity to build a system that can assist game masters to build extensive deep worlds, and prepare new content on the fly in a moment’s notice. Through combining traditional procedural generation techniques with generative AI, we can provide users with content generation that is high-quality while still being highly customisable to fit their needs.

My goal in making this site is to create a set of tools that can augment the use of LLM with traditional procedural generation tools, along with the ability to provide relevant context to aid game masters for TTRPGs in their ability to tell captivating stories.

## Primary Feature Overview:

The primary feature of the site revolves around creating customizable templates that enable procedural randomization, emulating the experience of using roll tables in tabletop games to generate dynamic content such as encounters, NPCs, loot, and more.

This feature will allow users to:

-   Define templates: Design templates for specific content types (e.g., encounters, NPCs, items, etc.) with customizable attributes, resulting in a wide variety of possible outcomes.
-   Relate existing entities: Connect new procedurally generated content to existing entities in the database (e.g., NPCs, items, locations, quests), promoting consistency and context within the game world. Example: A newly generated sword can be linked to a specific city within the database.
-   Integrate LLM-generated content: Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to assimilate the related entities and attributes into coherent and detailed descriptions for the generated content. This ensures that the new content is both contextually relevant and engaging for users.
